  <strong>Kanban with terminals. Card → Terminal → Agent.</strong>
  <br />
  Every card hides a terminal, a browser, git management, worktree, and much more. Agent management for humans.

> **macOS:** On first launch, macOS will show _"SlayZone can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software."_ Right-click the app → **Open** → click **Open** again to trust it. This only happens once.

### &nbsp;&#x1F916;&nbsp; Integrated AI agents

Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and more — running inside task terminals. Spin up as many as you need per task. Real PTY sessions, not sandboxed previews.

### &nbsp;&#x267B;&#xFE0F;&nbsp; Kanban board

Drag-and-drop tasks, priorities, tags, sub-tasks — all stored in local SQLite.

### &nbsp;&#x1F310;&nbsp; Embedded browser panels

Docs, PRs, and previews inside tasks — without leaving the app.

### &nbsp;&#x1F50D;&nbsp; Automatic status tracking

SlayZone watches your agents and tracks each task's status automatically — idle, working, or waiting for input.

### &nbsp;&#x1F33F;&nbsp; Git worktree per task

Isolated branches with built-in diff, conflict resolution, and commit UI. One branch per task, no more stashing half-finished work.

### &nbsp;&#x1F512;&nbsp; Fully local

Your agents run locally on your machine — SlayZone is just the interface.

### Known bugs

- Terminal sync works perfectly 99% of the time. Cmd+R is a current workaround for the other situations.
- Auto-status tracking only fully works for Claude Code — Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode adapters are partial
- macOS Gatekeeper blocks first launch — right-click → Open to bypass
- Large kanban boards (100+ cards) can feel sluggish during drag-and-drop
