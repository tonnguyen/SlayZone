# Open Questions

- SlayZone's own pricing/OSS status for the comparison page
- Which comparison axes to highlight on website? Suggest: kanban + embedded browser + local-first as the trinity
- Head-to-head pages (SlayZone vs X) or one unified comparison table?
- VibeKanban is 22k stars — how to position against a much larger community?
- Superset.sh just hit v1.0 and is architecturally very similar (Electron + xterm + Monaco + SQLite) — watch closely
- Conductor has YC backing and Stripe/Notion/Linear testimonials — threat if they add kanban
- Should diff/PR workflow be added to SlayZone? VibeKanban and Conductor both have it as core features
